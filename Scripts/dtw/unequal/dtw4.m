function path = dtw4(key_t,sig_t)
% path = dtw(key,input)
%
% dtw takes in a key signal, and an input signal and returns a path that
% maps the indices of the input to the indices of the key.  For example, if
% the key had 5 (1..N) elements and input had 6 (1..M), with 
% path = [1 2 [3,4] 5 6], the new input would have five elements with 
%
%     new_input(1) = input(1)
%     new_input(2) = input(2)
%     new_input(3) = some function of input(3) and input(4) - avg?
%     new_input(4) = input(5)
%     new_input(5) = input(6)
%
% The following restriction holds: w(1) = 1, w(N) = M
